Submission path for all assignment task during zuri internship program.

During the ATM improvement mock up task, I was able to learn the real life application of TRY, EXCEPT FUNCTION, RANDOM GENERATION OF NUMBERS (Another introduction to random generation of the combination of text and number for use in Matric Number cases), I was able to learn the real life application of functional programming.

I limited my account number to 223******* using random.randrange(2231111111, 2239999999), and it worked fine.
